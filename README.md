# StarJeweledRobot
A robot using image process to play the game StarJeweled of StarCraft II

This robot can only run on a screen of 1366x768 resolution now, because of some constants,I will try to improve it.

You should run StarCraft II in window(constants) mode, to let the robot cut the screen.

This program is just use as a demo of pywin32.
